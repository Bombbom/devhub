# How to Calculate Column Values in SQL

## Overview

SQL provides powerful capabilities for performing calculations on column values, enabling you to create computed fields, aggregate data, and transform information directly within your queries. This documentation covers various methods to calculate and manipulate column values in SQL.

!!! info "Key Concept"
    Calculated columns are expressions that derive their values from other columns or constants using mathematical operations, functions, or conditional logic.

## Basic Arithmetic Operations

### Mathematical Operators

SQL supports standard mathematical operators for numeric calculations:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | `price + tax` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `end_date - start_date` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `quantity * unit_price` |
| `/` | Division | `total_sales / total_customers` |
| `%` | Modulo (remainder) | `employee_id % 2` |

### Simple Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate total price including tax
SELECT 
    product_name,
    base_price,
    tax_rate,
    base_price * (1 + tax_rate) AS total_price
FROM products;

-- Calculate profit margin
SELECT 
    product_name,
    selling_price,
    cost_price,
    selling_price - cost_price AS profit,
    ((selling_price - cost_price) / selling_price) * 100 AS profit_margin_percent
FROM products;
```

!!! example "Real-world Example"
    ```sql
    -- Calculate employee monthly salary from annual salary
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        annual_salary,
        annual_salary / 12 AS monthly_salary,
        annual_salary / 52 AS weekly_salary
    FROM employees;
    ```

## Column Aliases

Always use meaningful aliases for calculated columns:

```sql
-- Good: Clear, descriptive aliases
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    order_total * 0.1 AS discount_amount,
    order_total * 0.9 AS final_amount
FROM orders;

-- Avoid: Generic or unclear aliases
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    order_total * 0.1 AS calc1,
    order_total * 0.9 AS result
FROM orders;
```

## Handling NULL Values in Calculations

### NULL Behavior

!!! warning "NULL in Calculations"
    Any arithmetic operation with NULL results in NULL. Always handle NULL values appropriately.

```sql
-- Problem: NULL values cause entire calculation to be NULL
SELECT 
    product_name,
    base_price + shipping_cost AS total_cost  -- NULL if shipping_cost is NULL
FROM products;

-- Solution: Use COALESCE or ISNULL to handle NULLs
SELECT 
    product_name,
    base_price + COALESCE(shipping_cost, 0) AS total_cost
FROM products;
```

### Database-Specific NULL Handling

```sql
-- MySQL: Use IFNULL
SELECT 
    product_name,
    base_price + IFNULL(shipping_cost, 0) AS total_cost
FROM products;

-- SQL Server: Use ISNULL
SELECT 
    product_name,
    base_price + ISNULL(shipping_cost, 0) AS total_cost
FROM products;

-- PostgreSQL: Use COALESCE
SELECT 
    product_name,
    base_price + COALESCE(shipping_cost, 0) AS total_cost
FROM products;
```

## String Calculations and Concatenation

### String Concatenation

```sql
-- Standard SQL: Use CONCAT function
SELECT 
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    CONCAT('$', FORMAT(salary, 2)) AS formatted_salary
FROM employees;

-- Alternative: Concatenation operator (database-specific)
-- PostgreSQL: Use ||
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM employees;

-- SQL Server: Use +
SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name
FROM employees;
```

### String Functions

```sql
-- Calculate string lengths and manipulations
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    LENGTH(customer_name) AS name_length,
    UPPER(customer_name) AS name_upper,
    SUBSTRING(customer_name, 1, 3) AS name_abbreviation,
    LEFT(customer_name, 1) AS first_initial
FROM customers;
```

## Date and Time Calculations

### Date Arithmetic

```sql
-- Calculate age, duration, and date differences
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    birth_date,
    hire_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, birth_date) / 365 AS age_years,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date) AS days_employed,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, CURRENT_DATE) AS years_of_service
FROM employees;
```

### Adding/Subtracting Time Periods

```sql
-- Calculate future and past dates
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_date,
    DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) AS expected_delivery,
    DATE_SUB(order_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY) AS order_deadline,
    ADDDATE(order_date, 14) AS follow_up_date
FROM orders;
```

!!! tip "Date Calculation Tips"
    Different databases have varying date functions:
    - **MySQL**: `DATEDIFF()`, `DATE_ADD()`, `DATE_SUB()`
    - **PostgreSQL**: `AGE()`, `EXTRACT()`, `+ INTERVAL`
    - **SQL Server**: `DATEDIFF()`, `DATEADD()`, `DATEPART()`

## Conditional Calculations (CASE Expressions)

### Basic CASE Statements

```sql
-- Calculate bonuses based on performance
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    salary,
    performance_rating,
    CASE 
        WHEN performance_rating >= 9 THEN salary * 0.15
        WHEN performance_rating >= 7 THEN salary * 0.10
        WHEN performance_rating >= 5 THEN salary * 0.05
        ELSE 0
    END AS bonus_amount
FROM employees;
```

### Complex Conditional Logic

```sql
-- Calculate shipping costs based on multiple conditions
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_total,
    shipping_distance,
    customer_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN customer_type = 'VIP' THEN 0
        WHEN order_total > 100 THEN 0
        WHEN shipping_distance <= 50 THEN 5.99
        WHEN shipping_distance <= 100 THEN 9.99
        ELSE shipping_distance * 0.15
    END AS shipping_cost
FROM orders;
```

## Aggregate Functions and Calculations

### Window Functions for Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate running totals and percentages
SELECT 
    order_date,
    daily_sales,
    SUM(daily_sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total,
    daily_sales / SUM(daily_sales) OVER () * 100 AS percent_of_total,
    LAG(daily_sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS previous_day_sales,
    daily_sales - LAG(daily_sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS daily_change
FROM daily_sales_summary
ORDER BY order_date;
```

### Group Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate department statistics
SELECT 
    department,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
    MAX(salary) AS max_salary,
    MIN(salary) AS min_salary,
    MAX(salary) - MIN(salary) AS salary_range,
    STDDEV(salary) AS salary_std_dev
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## Mathematical Functions

### Common Math Functions

```sql
-- Various mathematical calculations
SELECT 
    product_id,
    price,
    ROUND(price, 2) AS rounded_price,
    CEIL(price) AS price_ceiling,
    FLOOR(price) AS price_floor,
    ABS(price - 50) AS price_difference_from_50,
    POWER(price, 2) AS price_squared,
    SQRT(price) AS price_square_root,
    LOG(price) AS natural_log_price
FROM products
WHERE price > 0;
```

### Statistical Functions

```sql
-- Calculate statistical measures
SELECT 
    product_category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    AVG(price) AS mean_price,
    STDDEV(price) AS std_deviation,
    VARIANCE(price) AS price_variance,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) AS median_price
FROM products
GROUP BY product_category;
```

## Advanced Calculation Techniques

### Subquery Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate relative performance metrics
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    salary,
    (salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)) AS salary_vs_average,
    (salary / (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees)) * 100 AS salary_as_percent_of_max
FROM employees;
```

### Correlated Subquery Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate department rankings
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.first_name,
    e1.department,
    e1.salary,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM employees e2 
     WHERE e2.department = e1.department 
     AND e2.salary > e1.salary) + 1 AS department_salary_rank
FROM employees e1
ORDER BY e1.department, e1.salary DESC;
```

## Data Type Conversions in Calculations

### Explicit Type Casting

```sql
-- Convert data types for calculations
SELECT 
    order_id,
    CAST(order_total AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS decimal_total,
    CAST(order_date AS CHAR(10)) AS date_string,
    CONVERT(VARCHAR(20), order_total) AS total_string,
    TRY_CAST(customer_rating AS INT) AS rating_integer
FROM orders;
```

### Implicit Conversions

```sql
-- Be aware of automatic type conversions
SELECT 
    product_id,
    '$ ' + CAST(price AS VARCHAR(10)) AS formatted_price,  -- String concatenation
    quantity * 1.0 AS decimal_quantity,                    -- Force decimal result
    price / NULLIF(quantity, 0) AS price_per_unit         -- Avoid division by zero
FROM order_items;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Calculated Columns

!!! tip "Performance Optimization"
    - Create computed columns for frequently used calculations
    - Index computed columns when used in WHERE clauses
    - Consider materialized views for complex calculations

```sql
-- Create computed column (SQL Server example)
ALTER TABLE products 
ADD total_cost AS (base_cost + shipping_cost + tax);

-- Create index on computed column
CREATE INDEX IX_products_total_cost ON products (total_cost);
```

### Avoiding Expensive Operations

```sql
-- Efficient: Pre-calculate constants
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_total * 0.08 AS tax_amount  -- Good: constant multiplication
FROM orders;

-- Less efficient: Function calls in calculations
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_total * (SELECT tax_rate FROM tax_settings WHERE region = 'US') AS tax_amount
FROM orders;  -- Subquery executes for each row
```

## Error Handling in Calculations

### Division by Zero

```sql
-- Prevent division by zero errors
SELECT 
    product_name,
    total_sales,
    units_sold,
    CASE 
        WHEN units_sold = 0 THEN NULL
        ELSE total_sales / units_sold
    END AS average_sale_price,
    
    -- Alternative using NULLIF
    total_sales / NULLIF(units_sold, 0) AS avg_price_nullif
FROM product_sales;
```

### Overflow Handling

```sql
-- Handle potential numeric overflow
SELECT 
    order_id,
    quantity,
    unit_price,
    CASE 
        WHEN quantity > 1000000 OR unit_price > 1000000 THEN NULL
        ELSE quantity * unit_price
    END AS safe_total
FROM order_items;
```

## Common Calculation Patterns

### Financial Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate compound interest
SELECT 
    account_id,
    principal_amount,
    interest_rate,
    years,
    principal_amount * POWER(1 + interest_rate, years) AS future_value,
    principal_amount * POWER(1 + interest_rate, years) - principal_amount AS interest_earned
FROM investments;
```

### Percentage Calculations

```sql
-- Calculate various percentage metrics
SELECT 
    product_category,
    current_sales,
    previous_sales,
    current_sales - previous_sales AS sales_change,
    ((current_sales - previous_sales) / NULLIF(previous_sales, 0)) * 100 AS percent_change,
    (current_sales / SUM(current_sales) OVER ()) * 100 AS percent_of_total
FROM category_sales;
```

### Ranking and Scoring

```sql
-- Calculate normalized scores
SELECT 
    student_id,
    test_score,
    (test_score - MIN(test_score) OVER ()) / 
    NULLIF(MAX(test_score) OVER () - MIN(test_score) OVER (), 0) * 100 AS normalized_score,
    NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY test_score) AS decile_rank
FROM test_results;
```

## Best Practices

!!! success "Do's"
    - Always use meaningful aliases for calculated columns
